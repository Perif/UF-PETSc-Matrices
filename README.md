UF-PETSc-Matrices
=================

Matrices from the University of Florida sparse matrix collection in PETSc binary format using the [MatrixMarketToPETSc][1] conversion code.


For the moment, all matrices are complex and only a few from the collection have been converted (it takes a lot of time for some of them !)
